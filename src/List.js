    text:"In the original Japanese versions of Naruto, Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum -ttebayo (which achieves an effect similar to ending a sentence with you know? in English). Kishimoto wanted to give Naruto a childlike catchphrase, and dattebayo came to mind; he believed that the phrase complements Naruto's character, and served as a verbal tic that portrayed him in a brattish manner.[10] Throughout the first episodes of the English dub version, dattebayo and -ttebayo were replaced with the phrase Believe it!, both to mirror the effect, and to match the character's lip movements, although later in the English dub Naruto stopped saying Believe it and the phrase was replaced with You Know?.",
